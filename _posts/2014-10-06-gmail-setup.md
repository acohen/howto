## iPhone / iPad

1. On your device's home screen, open the Settings application.
2. Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
3. Tap Add Account. 
4. Tap Exchange. iOS 4.0+ allows multiple Exchange accounts. However, if you're on a device that doesn't let you add a second account, you could also use IMAP to sync Gmail, CalDAV to sync Google Calendar, and CardDAV to sync contacts.

10. Select the Google services you want to sync, such as Mail, Contacts, and Calendars and tap Save. To receive and respond to meeting requests on your device, you need to turn on both Mail and Calendar and New events in your Google Calendar settings. See below for more information.

Congrats! You've set up Google Sync!

Synchronization will begin automatically if you have Push enabled on your device. You can also open the Mail, Calendar, or Contacts app and wait a few seconds to start a sync. Note that if you've recently signed up for Google Apps for Work, Education, or Government, it can take a few hours (up to 24) before you're able to sync with your mobile device.

## Android

To use the native Google Apps mail, contacts, and calendar apps on your Android, you need to sign in to your Google Apps account. Instructions below are for users with a Nexus or Google Play edition device running Android 4.2 or higher. If you're using a different device, your setup instructions may vary. You only have to do this once:

1. Touch the Settings > Add account > Google to add your Google Apps account. ![screen shot 2014-10-06 at 10 56 31 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/81055/4527680/0f08603c-4d69-11e4-8248-b42928a837f7.png)

2. Select Existing and enter your full Google Apps email address as your username and your password. ![screen shot 2014-10-06 at 10 56 36 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/81055/4527692/2563d532-4d69-11e4-8df5-30b197a161bd.png)

3. Touch OK to agree to the Terms of Service. The device will sign in to your domain. This process may take a few minutes.

4. You may be presented with additional steps giving you the option to join Google+, opt in to Google Play communications, or set up a credit card to purchase Google Play media. You can choose to set these up or touch Not now.

5. After completing these steps, you should see Account sign-in successful. You can choose which services you want to sync to the device.

6. That's it! You can now use Google Apps from your Android. Just launch Gmail, Google Calendar, or whichever app you want to use.
