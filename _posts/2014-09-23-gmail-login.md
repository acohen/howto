> Moving _all_ of your email is going to take the computer-internet-machines a bit of time,
We will be keeping an eye on all migrations to make sure they're successful. 
> Once we're happy with your migration we're going to send you a Gmail new account email
with a temporary password to get you in.

_If you already have an InterExchange Gmail Account you will not receive this email_

Just follow the instructions on screen and you'll have a new account.
