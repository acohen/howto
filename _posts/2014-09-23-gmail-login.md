## Gmail Login and Verification

Moving _all_ of your email is going to take the computer-internet-machines a bit of time,
Dirk will be keeping an eye on all migrations to make sure they're successful.

### The Gmail Email

_try saying that 10 times_

Once Dirk is happy with your migration he is going to send you the gmail new account email
with a temporary password to get you in.
