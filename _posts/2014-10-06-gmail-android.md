To use the native Google Apps mail, contacts, and calendar apps on your Android, you need to sign in to your Google Apps account. Instructions below are for users with a Nexus or Google Play edition device running Android 4.2 or higher. If you're using a different device, your setup instructions may vary. You only have to do this once:

1. Touch the Settings > Add account > Google to add your Google Apps account. ![screen shot 2014-10-06 at 10 56 31 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/81055/4527680/0f08603c-4d69-11e4-8248-b42928a837f7.png)

3. Touch OK to agree to the Terms of Service. The device will sign in to your domain. This process may take a few minutes.

4. You may be presented with additional steps giving you the option to join Google+, opt in to Google Play communications, or set up a credit card to purchase Google Play media. You can choose to set these up or touch Not now.

5. After completing these steps, you should see Account sign-in successful. You can choose which services you want to sync to the device.

6. That's it! You can now use Google Apps from your Android. Just launch Gmail, Google Calendar, or whichever app you want to use.
