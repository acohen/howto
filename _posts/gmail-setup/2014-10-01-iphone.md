Congrats! You've set up Google Sync!

Synchronization will begin automatically if you have Push enabled on your device. You can also open the Mail, Calendar, or Contacts app and wait a few seconds to start a sync. Note that if you've recently signed up for Google Apps for Work, Education, or Government, it can take a few hours (up to 24) before you're able to sync with your mobile device.
