### Pinning to Top

Since your Hangout lists show you your recent conversations, you cannot group people by department. 

However, you can “pin” the people you chat with often to the top of your list.

#### To pin people to the top

* Hover over a person on your list
* Click to down arrow that appears next to their name
* Choose Pin to Top

### Sharing your Status

When you are active on Hangouts, others will see a green dot next to your picture. After a few minutes of being inactive, the green dot will disappear. You can share your status with others to let them know what you’re up to. 

#### To share your status

* Click the down arrow next to your name on the top of your Hangouts list
* Type your Status in the “Share your status…” field, at the top of the menu

### Unread Messages

You may receive messages while you are offline or away from your computer. The icons at the bottom of your list will show you if you have any unread messages.
