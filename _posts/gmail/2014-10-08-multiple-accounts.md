If you are already using Gmail, when you click the link to [sign in](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=mail) you may see your existing personal Gmail account.

To add your InterExchange account:

* Click **Sign in with a different account**
* Click **Add account**
* Enter your InterExchange email address.

You can remain logged into both accounts. 

You can switch between accounts by clicking on the mail address in the upper right hand corner of your screen and can keep accounts open in different windows or tabs.
