**Book a Conference Room**

To book a conference room for your meeting, create a new or edit an existing event in your calendar.

To add a room to your event, edit the event and click on the **Rooms, etc.** link. 

You will then see the rooms that are available for the meeting time you selected. Add the available room and it is now booked.

**What if I need a particular room for my meeting and I don't see it?**

If you know you need a particular room for your meeting, create your event. Click on **Rooms, etc.** and uncheck **"Show only available"**. 

Select the room you want for your meeting and then click on the **Find a time** tab. You will then see a view of your calendar compared with the calendar for the room and can see what times that particular room is available. You can also view the week to find availability on a different day.

**What if I see the room is busy but I really need that room at that time?**

While you are viewing Find a time, hover over the meeting to show the meeting details. Contact the event creator and ask them about changing their meeting room or meeting time.
