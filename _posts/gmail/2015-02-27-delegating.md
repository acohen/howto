You can delegate access to your Gmail to another person so they can read, send, and delete messages on your behalf while you are away from the office.

Any messages someone else sends from your account will have your name listed in addition to the other person's name, so they'll show the sender as: Your Name (sent by Delegate).
The delegate will not be able to change your password, account settings, or chat from your account.
