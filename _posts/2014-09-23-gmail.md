## Migration

We are Moving from Kerio to Gmail, and we're going to need your help getting there.

### 3. Kerio Migration Confirmation Email

First up we want you to have access to all your old emails, for this to work we're
going to need our migration software to login to your account and pull them over.

In order to do this we're using a tool called MigrationWiz. This will allow you to
share your sensitive password without telling it to someone (_reminder: never tell
anyone your password_)

#### The MigrationWiz Email

You're going to receive an email from Dirk that will look very similar to the one below.

Before clicking the link in the email be sure to verify

* The email came from dkelly@interexchange.org
* The url is to https://migrationwiz.com
* The email is requested from 208.115.102.19

**If you have any concerns at all forward the email to dkelly@interexchange.org to get confirmation**

#### The MigrationWiz Website

Once you click the link you will be presented with a page asking for your details.

Before entering your details and submitting the form be sure to verify

* The url in the address bar is secure (look for the padlock)
* The url in the address bar starts with https://www.migrationwiz.com/Public/UserInformation.aspx
* The requester email is dkelly@interexchange.org

### 2. Gmail Login and Verification

Moving _all_ of your email is going to take the computer-internet-machines a bit of time,
Dirk will be keeping an eye on all migrations to make sure they're successful.

### The Gmail Email

_try saying that 10 times_

Once Dirk is happy with your migration he is going to send you the gmail new account email
with a temporary password to get you in.

> If you already have an InterExchange Gmail Account you will not receive this email
