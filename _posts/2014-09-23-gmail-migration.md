# Migration

### What are we doing?

InterExchange is moving from having an in-house Kerio email server to using Gmail.

We will be making the official and final change over in October.

The process of setting up all of our mailboxes and moving all of our mail will happen in stages.

The first stage is migration.

We will move the majority of our mail over to gmail in the weeks before the switch over so that during the
weekend when we go live with Gmail we will only have a few weeks of recent messages to sync, not many years worth.

### What do I need to do?

Give us your password in a secure way so that we can move them over.

### Will this change my day-to-day?

Not yet, you will still access your email the same way you have been - using webmail or your email client (Entourage, Mail, Outlook, etc.).

We are just taking a copy now as a step towards the change over.

## Kerio Migration Confirmation Email

First up in order to move all your old emails, we're going to need our migration software to login to your account and pull them over.

In order to do this we're using a tool called MigrationWiz. This will allow you to share your sensitive password without telling it to someone.

**reminder: never tell anyone your password**

### The MigrationWiz Email

You're going to receive an email from Dirk that will look very similar to the one below.
Once you click the link you will be presented with a page asking for your details.

Before entering your details and submitting the form be sure to verify

* The url in the address bar is secure (look for the padlock)
* The url in the address bar starts with [https://www.migrationwiz.com/](https://www.migrationwiz.com)
* The requester email is migrationwiz@interexchange.org

**If you are unsure about your email password, test to see if you know it by logging into webmail 
[https://mail.interexchange.org](https://mail.interexchange.org) this will help confirm you are putting the correct password into MigrationWiz.

If you don't know your password and need to request a password reset, contact Hiran techsupport@interexchange.org and he can reset it. Once that is done you can enter your updated password into the MigrationWiz.**

### The MigrationWiz Website

Once you click the link you will be presented with a page asking for your details.

Before entering your details and submitting the form be sure to verify

* The url in the address bar is secure (look for the padlock)
* The url in the address bar starts with https://www.migrationwiz.com/Public/UserInformation.aspx
* The requester email is migrationwiz@interexchange.org

# That's It

We will migrate the majority of your emails over to Gmail, and for now that's all we need from you.
