# Migration

### What are we doing?

We're copying everyone's current email messages over to Gmail so that when
you log in during the coming weeks you haven't lost any messages.

### What do I need to do?

Give us your password in a secure way so that we can move them over.

### Will this change my day-to-day?

Not at all, you will still access your email the same way, we're just taking a copy.

## Kerio Migration Confirmation Email

First up we want you to have access to all your old emails, for this to work we're
going to need our migration software to login to your account and pull them over.

In order to do this we're using a tool called MigrationWiz. This will allow you to
share your sensitive password without telling it to someone (_reminder: never tell
anyone your password_)

### The MigrationWiz Email

You're going to receive an email from Dirk that will look very similar to the one below.

Before clicking the link in the email be sure to verify

* The email came from dkelly@interexchange.org
* The url is to https://migrationwiz.com
* The email is requested from 208.115.102.19

**If you have any concerns at all forward the email to dkelly@interexchange.org to get confirmation**
